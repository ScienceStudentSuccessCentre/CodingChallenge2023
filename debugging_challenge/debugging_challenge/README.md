# Bad Code

## What's the challenge?
The Idea of this challenge is to make this 'bad' code into better/more efficient code.
1. There are several syntax errors and missing lines throughout the classes, fix these errors and add any new lines necessary.
2. Make the classes follow OOP principles.
3. Make any changes to the code that you see fit so that the main in DebuggingTester can give you a score on your changes. DO NOT change the test cases.
4. Find and change one or more areas where you can make the code more efficient.

### Scoring
1. Your score will be: the score the tester gives you + 50 (if you have made changes to make the code more efficient)
