## 🥳 Introduction

Welcome to the SSSC's 2023 Coding Challenge! We've created several unique challenges that expose you to many areas of software development. Over the next couple of hours, you will try to solve as many of the provided challenges as you can.

The groups with the most points at the end of the night wins! 🏆 And don't worry - there will also be a random raffle at the end of the night, so make sure to stay the whole time and try your best!

## ✏️ Instructions

In this repo, there are 6 unique challenges for you to tackle! They vary in field and difficulty. You can complete them in any order you want, based on your interest! More instructions are provided with each challenge.

**WHEN YOU COMPLETE A CHALLENGE** let us know so that we can record your points! At the end of the night, we will calculate the number of points each student has earned!
