Challenge 1: MadStats.java

	Hints: ask reps for hints if needed.

	Description of each sub-challenge: 
		- There are functions max(),min(), mostCommon(), leastCommon(), mostCommon(), mean(). Read the commment above each function to understand their purpose.
		- It will be useful to notice the comments regarding the row numbering of the 2D array in the main() function.
	       
			   
	Restrictions: 
		- For the max() and min() functions, do not use any built in functions like sort, min, max etc.
		- Do not hard code solutions. Your code should be able to handle 2D arrays with other values.

	Expected Outputs for each function:
		max() : should return 321
		min() : should return -50
		mostCommon(): should return 4
		leastCommon(): should return 321, -5, or -50 (other answers may be acceptable as ties exist)
		mean(): should return [37.8, 22.5, 4.4, 2.0, 6.4, 8.0, -11.0, 6.4, 9.9]
	 
	Estimated time: 15 minutes
